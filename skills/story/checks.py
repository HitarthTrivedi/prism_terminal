"""Faults a program can see in a narrative piece.

Almost all of storytelling is taste, and a checker has no taste. What it
can see is the two failures that are not taste at all: the opening that
announces the industry instead of starting, and the piece with no
checkable specifics in it — which is what a fabricated story looks like
from the outside.
