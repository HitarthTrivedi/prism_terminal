Prism — pricing a measured take-off into a tender-ready Bill of Quantities
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
`core.boq` measures a drawing and hands back real, auditable quantities. This
module is the half that turns those quantities into the document a contractor
actually tenders with: a priced BOQ with rates, amounts, section sub-totals,
contingency, GST and a grand total — exported to Excel with LIVE formulas, so
the estimator opens it and keeps working, not a dead picture of a table.

The hard rule the whole BOQ add-on lives by holds here without exception:
**no number of record is ever produced by an AI.**

  · Quantities come from measured geometry (core.boq) — never a model.
  · Rates come from a rate library the user brings (their own price list, or a
    DSR/state-SOR export) or types in — matched to items by the same
    deterministic fuzzy matcher `core.quoting` uses for quotations, which
    RETURNS CANDIDATES and a confidence flag, never a silent decision. A match
    that isn't confident leaves the rate blank and the item flagged, because a
    wrong rate on a tender is worse than an obvious gap.
  · Every amount, sub-total, tax and total is arithmetic — Decimal here, and a
    live `=D*E` / `=SUM()` formula in the sheet, so the buyer can audit and
    edit it in Excel.

The Indian specifics this market requires (researched, not assumed): units per
IS 1200 (cum / sqm / m / kg / nos), an Abstract of Cost that carries each
section forward, contingency and GST as their own visible lines (works-contract
GST, CGST+SGST intra-state vs IGST inter-state), and the grand total spelled
out in the Indian numbering system (lakh/crore). Rate analysis (material +
labour + plant + O&P build-up), a digitised DSR/SOR library, RA bills and a
frozen baseline are the roadmap beyond this file — the model here is shaped so
they slot in without a rewrite.
