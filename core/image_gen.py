Prism — the default "visual" stage: FLUX 3 Klein, called directly through
OpenRouter, replacing ChatGPT as the picture-generation step most runs used
to drive in a browser.

Runs INSIDE Prism — no tab, no DALL-E account, no upload — the same shape
core.automation's other local renderers (Prism Studio/Reel/Motion) already
use: registered in core.agents.AGENT_REGISTRY as "Prism Image" with
local="flux_image", dispatched by core.automation._run_local(), and first
in CATEGORIES["visual"]["agents"] so a fresh install's default visual tool
is this API call, not a browser tab (roles.default_agents() picks the
first name in a category's own list).

The owner's own words: "replace that particular step where usually chatgpt
is responsible for the generation of images... with image generation
through API key and we are already using openrouter API key, and the model
for this particular purpose we would be choosing: FLUX 3 Klein... made
that thing as the default and first choice."

    real post can carry all kinds of extra information a phone number, a
    website, an offer, a brand tagline, OR SOMETHING ELSE ENTIRELY — a
    venue, a date, a hashtag, a price, a testimonial. Every client's ask

    Reported live, 2026-11-08, TWO bugs in one sitting:

    1. Attached a real logo, asked for a post, and the logo FLUX drew
       into the picture did not match it — this function never looked at
       `attachments` at all, so the only "logo" FLUX could make was its
       own guess from text. The real one is now cut out (core.assets, the
       same tool a client's flat-card logo already goes through
       elsewhere) and pasted on top of whatever FLUX draws, never asked
       of FLUX itself.

    2. Filled in real content on a post, then followed up with "use this
       logo" — and the new picture was random, because the OLD version of
       this function only ever grabbed `prior_text`'s single most recent
       entry verbatim (here, "use this logo" itself, or this stage's own
       earlier terse note — never the actual subject). `query` is now the
       run's real ask (the follow-up's own text on a follow-up), and
       `_context_from(prior_text)` is EVERY earlier stage's output, not
       just the latest — the same fix already made for generate_artwork.
