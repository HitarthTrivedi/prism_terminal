Prism Motion Graphics — a second pair of eyes on the finished frames
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The geometry checks (core.motion.measure) know where every box is and cannot
tell whether the frame is any good: a headline that fits but is lost in a sea
of empty page, a card with nothing in it, a phone number bigger than the brand
name. A small vision model can, for a fraction of a cent a frame — measured
11 Nov 2026: Claude Haiku 5.5 at $0.0004 a frame found the clipped text, the
run-off phone number and the dead areas in a model-written film that the
estimate-based checker had passed.

Opt-in. It sends rendered frames of the client's own film to a third-party
model, so it runs only when config `motion_critic` is true and an OpenRouter
key is set — the same explicit choice the BOQ add-on asks for before it sends
a drawing. It reports; it does not repair (repair needs the writer again).
