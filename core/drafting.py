Prism — writing the awkward emails, using the tools already in the browser
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Everywhere else in the inquiry workflow, the AI does small mechanical jobs:
which pile does this message belong in, is this reply a yes or a no. Those are
one-word answers on a ten-minute timer, and Groq answers them in a second for
nothing.

Winning back a customer who has just said no is not that job. It is a page of
persuasion that has to know what was quoted, what the customer objected to,
and exactly how far this particular owner is willing to move on price. It
happens a handful of times a week, the owner reads every word before it goes,
and it is worth the best writing available.

So it goes where Prism's other writing goes: through the tools the customer is
already signed in to in their own Chrome — Claude, ChatGPT, whichever they
picked. Their subscription, their account, no API key, no per-token cost.

WHAT DOES NOT COME THROUGH HERE, AND WHY
────────────────────────────────────────
Sorting two hundred emails. A browser round trip is the better part of a
minute and needs the window; two hundred of them is most of a working day with
the customer's own Chrome held hostage. Local rules and one batched Groq call
do that in seconds.

Writing to the register. It is tempting — the tools can certainly produce a
CSV — but the register is the customer's order book, and Python already writes
it atomically, gets the money right to the paisa, and cannot hallucinate a row.
Sending somebody's order book out to a website to have one cell changed would
be slower, less reliable, and would put the whole file somewhere it has no
reason to be.

The rule this module encodes: **the browser tools write prose; Python does the
arithmetic and owns the file.**
