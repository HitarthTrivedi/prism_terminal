Prism — /step: measure a 3D CAD model the way /gerber measures a PCB job
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
A customer sends a .STEP file of the product — a sheet-metal enclosure, a
plastic part — and the fab's estimator opens it in CAD and reads the
numbers off by hand: overall size, each part's size, wall thickness, every
hole. This module does that reading offline, on this machine, with the
same rules as the Gerber add-on:

  · No AI ever sees the STEP file. The customer's design is their product;
    only the measured numbers leave this module.
  · Everything shown is measured from the real geometry (OpenCascade, via
    the cadquery package) — never guessed, never generated.
  · Two decimal places everywhere a figure is shown or written.

What comes out, per part and for the assembly:

  · the formed (as-modelled) size L x W x H — NOTE: for bent sheet metal
    this is the finished part, not the unfolded flat sheet; the report
    says so, because a fab drawing often quotes the flat size;
  · a wall/sheet thickness ESTIMATE (2V/A — exact for a plain sheet, a
    little under for a part full of holes; the report calls it an
    estimate);
  · every hole, grouped by diameter with a count of distinct positions
    (a slot's two rounded ends count as two positions);
  · volume, surface area, and weight at common material densities —
    CRC steel for metal moulding, ABS/PP/PC/Nylon for plastic.

Deliverables written beside the terminal output, every one of them named
after the customer's own file — for Assem1.STEP:

  · Assem1 - dimensions.xlsx           — one row per part in the drawing's
                                         own style ("101.00 x 93.00 x 71.00
                                         mm — 1 nos") plus a hole table,
                                         readable by the estimator's Excel;
  · Assem1 - drawing sheet.png         — everything: every part's flat
                                         pattern (or formed 3-view) and
                                         isometric, one page, drawn
                                         straight to PNG (Pillow — no
                                         browser, no intermediate HTML or
                                         SVG file);
  · Assem1 - <part> - flat pattern.png — one per part that has a flat
                                         pattern, that part alone, full
                                         page, no isometric column — the
                                         image a person actually cuts from.

The name is the whole point of the prefix: an estimator keeps ten jobs'
sheets in one folder, and "dimensions.xlsx" ten times over is ten files
nobody can tell apart. See names() and output_dir() — where the files go
is the caller's choice (the GUI asks the person), the default is a folder
per model under ~/Desktop/Prism Step.

# ── flat pattern (unfolding a formed sheet-metal part) ──────────────────────
#
# A formed bend, as OCCT models it, is a cylindrical strip between two flat
# faces -- two of them, actually: an inner and an outer surface, the
# thickness apart, because the material has thickness. OCCT also leaves a
# small cylindrical fillet at almost every hole's edge, which is ALSO a
# partial cylinder and would otherwise be indistinguishable from a real
# bend. The one reliable difference, found by reading a real customer
# STEP file's faces directly rather than guessing: a bend's cylindrical
# face is as long as the panel it folds (tens or hundreds of mm); a hole's
# edge fillet is only ever as long as the sheet is thick (under 1 mm on
# the sample job). `_bend_candidates` uses exactly that.
#
# Unfolding itself: walk the bend graph from the largest flat face (kept
# fixed), and at each bend rotate the NEXT flat face about the bend's own
# axis by the bend's own measured angle, so its normal ends up parallel to
# the fixed face's -- exact rigid rotation, not an approximation. The
# rotation alone leaves the two faces' edges the FORMED distance apart
# (going around the bend radius); the flat pattern needs them the FLAT
# distance apart instead, so that gap is measured after the rotation and
# corrected to the real bend-allowance figure
# (angle x (radius + K x thickness)) along the same direction the rotation
# already put them in. A part whose bends do not resolve this way --
# anything beyond straight folds between flat panels -- is left unfolded,
# not guessed at.

    direction by the real bend-allowance distance.

    That push is exact, not measured-and-corrected: `e_here` and
    `e_there` are the bend's own two boundary edges, both at the SAME
    radius from the SAME axis (they belong to one cylindrical face), so
    rotating `other` by the bend's own measured angle always lands
    `e_there` exactly ON `e_here` -- a zero gap every time, by
    construction, whatever the bend allowance should be. Measuring "the
    gap" there and correcting toward the target — an earlier version of
    this function did exactly that — reads back a real distance and a
    real direction, but the distance is always zero and the direction is
    just floating-point noise, so the correction it computed was zero
    too, silently, for every bend on every part. The fix does not need a
    measurement: the direction to push `other` out along is simply away

# looking right while quietly mis-stating a figure. Every line below is
# projected from the real geometry (OpenCascade hidden-line removal), every
# number is the measured one to two decimals, and it takes a second.

# The three standard views. `n` is the direction the camera looks FROM (the
# convention cadquery's exporter uses), `x` the axis that reads left-to-right
# on paper — fixed explicitly so Z is always up in the front and side views
# and Y is up in the top view, instead of whatever OpenCascade picks.
