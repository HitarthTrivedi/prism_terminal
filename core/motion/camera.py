"""
Prism Motion Graphics — camera grammar and safe areas
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Two things the model used to have to get right by hand, now compiled:

1. **One global camera curve.** A scene names a *shot* — what the camera
   does for that beat (hold, reveal, push, pull, orbit, parallax, macro,
   resolve) and what it looks at — and `compile_tracks()` turns the
   sequence into a single `camera.tracks` list the runtime walks
   continuously. Each track only states where the camera ENDS, so every
   shot starts wherever the previous one left the camera; the model can
   no longer reset the camera to the same centre and zoom at every cut,
   because it never writes camera values per scene at all.

2. **Safe areas for 9:16.** Where platform chrome (username, caption,
   buttons) covers a vertical frame, and the title/action zones that stay
   clear. `inspect.py` checks text and images against them.

Stdlib only, no browser: the runtime's Camera.evaluate() is a plain
piecewise walk over these tracks, so what is computed here is what plays.
