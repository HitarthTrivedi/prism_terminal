Prism — PCB fabrication data from Gerber + drill files (/gerber)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
No AI ever measures the board. Same principle as core/boq.py, and for the
same reason: a Gerber file is exact vector geometry — apertures, draws,
flashes, filled regions — and an LLM asked to eyeball a picture of it can
only produce plausible-looking numbers. A wrong minimum track width is a
scrapped panel or a mis-quoted job, so this module measures the geometry
itself, deterministically, and an AI stage only ever sees the numbers
afterward (to write the quote or the reply, never to produce the figures).

It answers the five questions a fab actually asks of an incoming job:

    1. PCB size            — from the board OUTLINE, not the ink bounding box
    2. minimum track width — smallest aperture actually used to DRAW copper
    3. minimum track spacing — real copper-to-copper clearance, by geometry
    4. minimum drill size  — smallest tool with at least one hit
    5. number of drills    — total hits, and the per-tool breakdown

WHY THE OBVIOUS IMPLEMENTATION IS WRONG
───────────────────────────────────────
Every one of these has a naive answer that looks right and isn't. The three
that bite, all three observed on real customer jobs:

  • SIZE IS NOT THE BOUNDING BOX. Fiducials, tooling holes, a legend block
    and stray title text sit outside the board edge and inflate the extents.
    One real job measured 3.600 x 3.750 in by bounding box and 3.550 x 3.550
    in by its actual outline — a 10% error in area, straight into the price.
    So the outline layer is polygonised and the largest closed face wins;
    the bounding box is a last resort and says so loudly.

  • THE SMALLEST GAP IS USUALLY NOISE. Two shapes meant to touch, rounded
    apart by the file's own coordinate resolution, leave a hairline gap of a
    few hundredths of a mil. Reported raw, that becomes "minimum spacing:
    0.31 mil" and the job looks unbuildable. Gaps below a snap tolerance are
    therefore treated as touching (and counted separately, never hidden),
    and the full gap distribution is reported alongside the minimum so a
    single outlier at one connector is visibly different from the design
    rule the whole board was routed to.

  • THE SMALLEST APERTURE MAY BARELY EXIST. One job's minimum track was 8
    mil — across 2.3 inches of trace, against 304 inches at 50 mil. That is
    a true minimum and a misleading headline, so the width table carries
    segment count and total length per width. The fab decides.

WHAT IS SUPPORTED
─────────────────
RS-274X: FS format spec (leading/trailing zero suppression, absolute),
MO units, AD aperture definitions (C circle, R rectangle, O obround,
P regular polygon), D01/D02/D03, G01 linear, G02/G03 circular in both
G74 single-quadrant and G75 multi-quadrant, G36/G37 filled regions, and
LPD/LPC polarity (clear polarity SUBTRACTS — a plane's clearances are
drawn that way, and ignoring it merges every net on the board into one).

Excellon drill: M48 header, INCH/METRIC and M72/M71, tool table with
diameters, leading/trailing zero suppression and decimal coordinates,
and repeat counts.

DISCLOSED LIMITATIONS (not hidden — a wrong number is worse than a gap)
  • Aperture macros (%AM) define arbitrary custom shapes. Flashes using one
    are counted but not given geometry, so they take no part in the spacing
    measurement. Every affected layer is named in the warnings.
  • Step-and-repeat (%SR) panelisation is detected and reported, but the
    repeats are not expanded; the measurement describes one image.
  • Spacing is measured WITHIN each copper layer. Layer-to-layer spacing is
    a stackup question, not a Gerber one.
  • Arcs are flattened to chords at ~0.005 mm sagitta. That is finer than
    any fabrication tolerance, but it is an approximation.
  • Nets are inferred from touching copper on one layer. Two shapes on the
    same net that only join through a via on another layer read as two
    islands, so the gap between them is reported as clearance. It is real
    copper-to-copper distance either way; it just may not be a violation.

    real Eleteck jobs read "min line 10 mil" from their own part numbers on
    boards routed at 12–50, and the Argus job read 9.8 against the fab's
    11.8, all from this.

    The tell is the SEGMENT, and the safeguards carry the weight. A letter
    wiggles every fraction of a millimetre — the AST03 text pen's median
    segment is 0.17 mm over 279 segments — while a track pen's segments
    run straight between pads. A pen is called a text pen only when ALL of
    these hold, so a genuinely thin routed board can never lose its answer:

      · the pen is thin (≤ 0.45 mm) and busy (≥ 50 segments);
      · its median segment is under 0.35 mm;
      · a WIDER circular pen also draws serious length on the layer —
        lettering annotates a board that has real tracks; a board routed
        entirely at one thin width keeps that width.
