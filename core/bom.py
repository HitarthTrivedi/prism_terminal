"""Bill of Materials — the parts list to FABRICATE a thing, from its drawing.

Sibling of core.boq, and it shares boq's whole measurement backbone: the DWG is
converted and measured by boq.ensure_dxf/measure (real geometry, never an AI),
and the same measured dict is handed here. The difference is entirely in what
the numbers MEAN and how they are written up:

    BOQ  →  quantities of construction WORK, grouped by trade, for a QS to price
    BOM  →  the PARTS to make a fabricated product, with material, grade and spec

A fabrication GA drawing (a crusher, a conveyor, an over-band magnetic
separator) is a manufactured assembly, so the measured data reads as parts, not
trades:

  · block INSERT counts        →  discrete part quantities (4 idler rollers,
                                   24 M-16 bolts, 2 bushes …)
  · layer/block names          →  part identities (DRIVE_SHAFT, ANGLE_CLEAT …)
  · polyline lengths per layer →  cut-to-length stock (channels, flats, angles,
                                   plate edges) as running length / pieces
  · closed areas per layer     →  plate area for a weight take-off

This module holds only the two PROMPT builders that reframe that data as a BOM;
measurement, DWG→DXF conversion and the CSV all stay in core.boq and are reused
unchanged, so the two add-ons can never disagree about the numbers.
