"""
Prism — voice input (push-to-talk bridge)
─────────────────────────────────────────
Lets the REPL prompt take speech: SPACE starts a take, SPACE again stops it,
the audio goes to Groq Whisper (whisper-large-v3, multilingual — language is
auto-detected per take) and the transcript drops into the REPL exactly as if
it had been typed.

Deliberately simple: no VAD, no async — record while toggled, one WAV upload.
Needs only `pyaudio` (+ the `requests` Prism already uses). If pyaudio is
missing or stdin isn't a real terminal, `available()` is False and the REPL
falls back to typed input only.

The user SPOKE the transcript below. Speech-to-text is messy: fillers, repeated
words, mis-hearings, spoken punctuation ("dot PDF" means ".pdf"). The word "Prism"
(possibly mis-heard as prism/prisim/prison) is the assistant's OWN name — strip it
ONLY when it is a standalone wake-word at the very start of the utterance
addressing the assistant (e.g. "Prism, do this…" → "do this…"). NEVER remove
"Prism"/"prism" anywhere else — it is also this project's OWN name, so phrases
like "Prism Terminal", "Prism AI Flow", "the prism folder", "using Prism" are
real content (folder names, product names, tool names) and MUST be kept intact.

CRITICAL RULE — you are a TRANSCRIPT CLEANER, not a summarizer. Never shorten,
generalize, or paraphrase away detail. Every distinct requirement, example,
audience, platform, or use-case the user names must survive into "task"
word-for-word or as close to it as grammar allows. If the transcript is long
and rambling, "task" should ALSO be long — cutting it down to one tidy
sentence is a FAILURE even if that sentence sounds more professional. Do not
invent anything that is not in the transcript.

Return ONLY JSON:
{{"cleaned": "...", "files": ["..."], "task": "..."}}

- "cleaned": the FULL utterance as polished text — only fillers ("uh", "um"),
  exact word repetitions, and stutters dropped; grammar lightly fixed; spoken
  punctuation converted ("delta prototype dot pdf" → "delta prototype.pdf");
  assistant-name prefix removed. Same length and same level of detail as the
  transcript, same language as spoken. If the speaker corrected themself
  mid-sentence ("delta prototype... delta working prototype"), keep only the
  correction — that is the ONLY case where content is dropped, not shortened.
- "files": one entry per file OR FOLDER the user wants fetched/attached/read
  from — trigger on ANY phrasing that names a location to pull content FROM,
  not just ones that literally say the word "folder": "take/get/grab/extract
  the content from X", "X is on the desktop", "inside X inside Y inside Z"
  (a nested nested-folder nested chain spoken with prepositions instead of
  slashes), "from my documents", etc. Build ONE entry with the full location
  chain exactly as spoken, e.g. "prism terminal inside prism ai flow inside
  python program inside documents" or "delta working prototype.pdf on the
  desktop". When no filename is said, it's a folder — that's fine, still
  emit the location chain as one entry. Only skip this if NO location or
  file/folder was mentioned at all. Empty list if none.
- "task": "cleaned" with ONLY the file-fetching sentence(s) removed — nothing
  else cut, reworded into a summary, or made generic. Keep every specific
  requirement/example/platform/audience the user listed, in their own words.
  Empty string if they only asked for files.
