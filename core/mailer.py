Prism — email blasts (/email)
─────────────────────────────
Mail-merge through the pipeline: the user attaches a CSV of recipients and a
source document (e.g. a brochure PDF). The pipeline analyses the document,
the drafting agent is locked to output ONLY the email (strict SUBJECT/BODY
format — nothing else survives into the send), and then Prism itself sends
the email to every address in the CSV through the user's own account (SMTP,
stdlib smtplib — no new dependencies).

The CSV is never shown to any AI: recipients are parsed locally, so the
address list never leaves this machine.

    on_progress(i, total, email, ok, error) is called after every attempt, and
    should_stop() is polled between them — a blast of 200 addresses takes
    minutes at SEND_DELAY, and the GUI needs both a live count and a way out.
    Neither is used by the CLI, which has ui.* and Ctrl-C for the same jobs.

    Pace and limits — the three knobs a list send needs so it does not read
    as spam to the provider or to the people on it:
      delay + jitter   the gap between two messages: `delay` seconds plus a
                       random 0..`jitter` on top (pause_after_send)
      limit            send to at most this many this run; 0 = everyone.
                       The rest are not attempted and are reported as such
      start_at         a wall-clock time (time.time()) to begin at; the
                       login happens only once it arrives, so a send set for
                       the morning does not hold an SMTP session open all
                       night. on_wait(seconds_left) ticks once a second
