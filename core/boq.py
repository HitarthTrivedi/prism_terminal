Prism — Bill of Quantities from a CAD drawing (/boq)
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
No AI ever measures the drawing. A DWG/DXF is real vector geometry — lines,
polylines, arcs, blocks — and an LLM asked to eyeball a rasterized picture of
it can only guess plausible-looking numbers, which is worthless (or worse,
dangerous) for a document a client will price work against. So this module
does the measuring itself, deterministically, with a CAD library that reads
the actual entity coordinates: lengths from LINE/LWPOLYLINE/POLYLINE/ARC,
areas from closed polylines and HATCH boundaries, counts from INSERT (block)
references. The output is a plain quantities CSV — auditable, re-openable in
Excel, and never silently trusted. An AI stage only ever sees THAT structured
data afterward, to write it up as a professionally formatted BOQ document
(item numbers, descriptions, grouping by trade) — formatting is exactly what
it's good at; measuring is exactly what it isn't.

Real drawings keep teaching this module conventions it didn't know about —
read HVAC_DRAWING_RULES.md (same folder) before changing anything that
walks LINE/LWPOLYLINE/POLYLINE geometry, and add to it, in its own shape,
the next time a real client file finds another one.

.dwg is a proprietary binary format ezdxf cannot read directly. It must be
converted to .dxf (an open, documented format) FIRST, on the user's own
machine, with one of:

  • GNU LibreDWG (free, scriptable, recommended):
        macOS   →  brew install libredwg          (gives the `dwg2dxf` CLI)
        Linux   →  build LibreDWG from source (many current Debian/Ubuntu
                    repositories do not package the `dwg2dxf` utility)
    Coverage of newer/exotic DWG features is not perfect — good enough for
    ordinary 2D architectural drawings, which is the common case here.

  • ODA File Converter (free, more complete, GUI-first but scriptable):
        https://www.opendesign.com/guestfiles/oda_file_converter
    On Windows it installs under %ProgramFiles%\\ODA\\ODAFileConverter*\\ and
    does NOT add itself to PATH — find_dwg_converter() globs that location, so
    no PATH surgery is needed there. On Linux, put `ODAFileConverter` on PATH.

ensure_dxf() detects whichever is installed; if neither is, it raises a clear
error naming both options rather than failing obscurely.

KNOWN LIMITATIONS (disclosed, not hidden):
  • Curved polyline segments (bulges) are measured exactly for LWPOLYLINE;
    legacy POLYLINE segments are treated as straight (a documented
    approximation — rare in modern exports).
  • HATCH boundaries that are true splines/ellipses are measured via their
    control/fit points, not exact curve integration — fine for the polygonal
    boundaries architectural floor hatches almost always use.
  • Numbers are only as good as the source drawing's layer/block discipline.
    A drawing with everything dumped on layer "0" with no named blocks will
    still parse, but the grouping will be useless — this tool cannot invent
    structure the drawing never had.

# ── double-line ductwork/pipework ───────────────────────────────────────────
# HVAC_DRAWING_RULES.md rule 1, found 22 Oct 2026 on a real HVAC test file: a
# duct (also a pipe, a cable tray — anything with real width worth drawing to
# scale) is very often drawn as its TWO EDGES, not one centreline, in ordinary
# professional CAD practice. Counting every LINE on the layer, oblivious to
# this, silently double-counted a run's length — summed BOTH edges as if they
# were two separate runs. Caught comparing Prism's own 78.82 m against an
# AI's own direct read of the same drawing, 38.80 m: a client's real file, not
# a corner case built to test with.

                   near-equal-length, a small constant distance apart —
                   counted once, at the average of its two edges.
      "transition" a tapering reducer between two different-width pairs
                   (rule 2, added 23 Oct 2026, found on the same real file
                   rule 1 came from: a reducer is drawn as two short lines
                   that CONVERGE, not run parallel, so rule 1's own pairing
                   correctly leaves them unmatched — but counting both
                   diagonals in full double-counts the transition by about
                   its own length. Detected the same way a pair's own
                   offset is validated: both ends sit a plausible duct-width
                   apart (20-2000 mm), just a DIFFERENT width at each end —
                   that difference is what makes it a transition and not a
                   pair — and the transition itself is no longer than the
                   widest confirmed pair on the layer, so an unrelated long
                   diagonal line elsewhere can never be mistaken for one.
      "single"     no match — an ordinary single-line (centreline/
                   schematic) run, counted at its own full length, exactly
                   as before rule 1 ever existed.
      "bridged"    two collinear, same-width "pair" runs with a small gap
                   between them, joined into one continuous run (rule 2's
                   gap-bridging, revisited with real topology — see below).

    A short perpendicular stub that closes a pair's open end (not route
    length, just the drawing closing the rectangle) is dropped entirely —
    it appears in none of the kinds above.

    Two SEPARATE same-length parallel runs (e.g. a flow pipe and a return
    pipe) are safe by construction as long as the drawing keeps them on
    separate layers, which is the normal convention this whole module

    # The original version of this idea bridged every such gap and was

    # branches off BOTH sides at the same point reads as one continuous
    # run straight through its own body, silently adding the trunk's own
    # width (400-800mm per occurrence there) as if it were missing duct.
    # This version adds the real topology check that was missing — found
    # by reproducing that exact file (`hvac_tender_complex.dxf`,
    # M-DUCT-SUPPLY): every real gap in it has a crossing branch's
    # endpoint landing exactly inside the gap (confirmed at (13275, 16400)
    # and (13725, 15600), where two branches cross the trunk from opposite
    # sides at the same point) — so this check correctly leaves all of
