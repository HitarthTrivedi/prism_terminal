/**
 * MotionTransitions — the cross-scene cut library Motion was missing
 * entirely (every cut used to be a hard visibility toggle). `push`/
 * `push_up`/`squeeze`/`zoom` carry the same motion design as
 * core.reel_web.py's own `.cut-push/-push-up/-squeeze/-zoom` (itself
 * adapted from HyperFrames under Apache 2.0 — see prism_gui/NOTICE), now
 * expressed as real GSAP tweens rather than that file's pure-CSS
 * calc()-of-progress-variables reimplementation, since Motion has GSAP
 * throughout and doesn't need the dependency-free workaround Studio built
 * specifically because IT has no GSAP. `blur_swoosh`/`light_leak`
 * translate the Meridian HyperFrames reference's own two transitions
 * directly (its blur-swoosh: filter/skew/x/opacity; its light-leak:
 * overlapping radial-gradient blobs) — same motion, GSAP tween shape
 * matching every other tween in this runtime instead of that project's
 * own gsap.timeline() calls (translated, not copied — Meridian is a
 * reference example, not a dependency).
 *
 * Every transition is keyed off the SAME already-computed timing fields
 * resolver.py stamps onto the resolved spec (scene.start,
 * scene.transitionInStart, scene._transitionOverlap) — nothing here
 * recomputes overlap timing.
