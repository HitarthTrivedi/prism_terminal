Prism — reel renderer, HTML/CSS edition
───────────────────────────────────────
The agent designs the video. This module only guarantees it is a video.

core/reel.py draws every pixel in Pillow, which is why every reel it makes
shares one look: the layouts, the background, the palette structure and the
motion are all Python. Two clients get the same film with different words.

This renderer takes the opposite position, and it is the same one Claude
Design and Remotion take: the design surface is a browser. The writing stage
sends CSS and markup it wrote itself — its own background, type, colour,
composition and motion — and the only things fixed here are the frame size,
the seeking, the encoding, and a legibility check that runs before anything
is written to disk.

How the seeking works (the part that makes a web page filmable):

  · the page declares ordinary CSS @keyframes animations
  · nothing is allowed to run in real time — every animation is PAUSED and
    its currentTime is set explicitly for each frame
  · so frame 240 is identical whether it was reached in sequence, out of
    order, or a week later. A recording would not be; a seek is.

That is why this is a renderer and not a screen capture.

Licence note: no Remotion code is used or required. The technique — a paused
browser timeline, screenshotted per frame, piped to FFmpeg — is not anyone's
property, and this implementation is ours.

    This used to ask for the whole reel in one reply, and that single fact was
    what made every reel look like a slide deck. Measured against a reel built
    by hand with a coding agent: 20,300 characters of markup and motion per
    scene there, 278 characters per scene here. Not a taste gap — a budget
    one. A model asked for seven scenes in one JSON object spreads a few
    thousand characters across all of them, and 278 characters holds a
    headline and a subhead. That IS a slide; there is nothing in it to move.

    So the design stage is a conversation now. This prompt is turn one: the
    palette, the type, the shared stylesheet, and a storyboard giving every
    scene a distinct job. Each scene is then written on its own turn by
    scene_instructions(), with the whole reply to spend on one scene.
