Prism — Agent Registry & Category Map
─────────────────────────────────────
The single source of truth for every AI tool Prism can drive, and how the
six selectable categories map onto the sequential automation pipeline.

A tool lives ONCE in AGENT_REGISTRY. Its category is contextual — the same
entry (e.g. "Claude", "ChatGPT", "LAZYCOOK", "Kimi 2.6") is offered under
multiple categories because it is genuinely multi-domain. The stage it runs
under is decided by the user's selection + the router, not by the registry.
"""

# ── Pipeline order ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Stages run top-to-bottom. Each stage feeds its output forward as context to
# the next. A stage only runs if (a) the user assigned an agent to it AND
# (b) the router marks it "needed" for the current query.
PIPELINE_ORDER = [
    "research",       # ground the task in facts / papers / computation
    # Finding prospects is not research and must not have to fight it for the
    # same slot — exactly the reason audio was split out of media below. An
    # outreach run usually needs BOTH: research to work out which industries
    # to go after, THEN leads to pull the actual companies in them. Sharing
    # one stage forced a choice between a tool that reads the web and a tool
    # that reads a contact database, which are not substitutes.
    #
    # It sits AFTER research on purpose. Research narrows the segment; the
    # lead database then filters inside it. The other way round you are
    # picking companies before you know what you are looking for.

# Appended verbatim to ChatGPT's visual/presentation prompts. Two jobs: make
# it actually reach for the connected Canva app, and make it hand back the
# share LINK — an editable design nobody can open is worth less than a flat
# image. The "if you cannot" clause matters: without it, a ChatGPT with no
# Canva app connected spends its reply explaining that it can't, instead of
# producing the picture that was asked for.
# Asked for an editable design — but the picture is still made properly first.
#
# This used to say "build it in Canva RATHER THAN a flat image", and the
# comment below has always admitted what that costs: Canva composes a template
# where DALL-E renders the scene that was described. So the customer had to
# choose between a good picture and an editable one.
#
# They do not. Generate the image at full quality here, and a SECOND prompt in
# the same chat (_CANVA_FOLLOWUP, sent by automation._make_editable) hands the
# finished artwork to the Canva app to be made editable. Best picture and an
# editable file, because the two steps stopped competing for one prompt.

    "you to make it editable in a follow-up message once I have seen it."
)

# The second half, sent into the SAME conversation once the artwork exists.
#
# Addressed to the Canva app with "@canva" because that is how ChatGPT routes
# a message to a connected app, and by this point the design it should act on
# is the image directly above it in the thread.

# stock layouts, its own type, its own arrangement — where DALL·E renders the
# scene that was actually described. For "da Vinci sipping Wagh Bakri chai"
# that is the whole job, and a template cannot do it.
#
# Which is why the editable path no longer asks Canva to compose anything: it
# generates first and converts second. The two suffixes are now identical in
# what they ask for, and differ only in what happens next — kept as separate
# constants because they answer different questions, and collapsing them would
# make the next person think the distinction had been dropped.
#
# Left to itself, a ChatGPT with the Canva app connected reaches for it far
# too readily — so when the user has not asked for an editable design, saying
# nothing is not enough. It has to be told not to.

    # Apollo is a filter-and-table app, not a chat box: there is no assistant
    # bubble to scrape, so the response selector targets the results grid and
    # the stage after it is expected to turn rows into a recipients CSV.
    #
    # It is driven by URL rather than by typing, which is what `search_tool`
    # switches on (see automation._run_apollo). Apollo encodes every filter
    # into its own address bar, so setting them there sets exactly the same
    # state as clicking through the left rail — and needs no selector for the
    # filter widgets, which are the part of the page most likely to churn.
    # The selectors below are still used, but only for the results grid and
    # for the typed-search fallback when the previous stage gave us nothing
    # parseable.
    #
    # Apollo does have ONE place that takes prose: the "Use Apollo AI to find
    # the right prospects" box on an empty People page. Text entered there is
    # handed to Apollo's AI Assistant, which turns it into filters and applies
    # them to the table (verified with Playwright, Sep 2026: a 74-character
    # prompt became Titles + Company keywords + Location and 8 rows, and the
    # box kept a 4,000-character paste with no maxlength). It is NOT the
    # toolbar "Search people" box beside the filter button — that one is a
    # plain keyword search and matches nobody when given a sentence, which is
    # where the fallback used to type. Each prompt spends one assistant chat
    # (the free plan shows "N CHATS LEFT" in the panel), so the URL route
    # stays first whenever the previous stage handed over a filter block.
