Prism — the routing brain (Groq)

Takes the user's raw query + their profile + the agents they enabled, and asks
Groq to split the task into a self-contained prompt (or several) for each
pipeline stage — marking stages "needed": false when they don't apply.

Generalised from the original 4-stage version to the full six categories, and
tailored by the user's "what do you do" profile.

# ── surviving Groq ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Hosted open models get retired on a few weeks' notice, and every install
# carries the same default. A single hardcoded model name means the day Groq
# drops it, every customer stops being able to plan anything, at the same hour,
# with "model_not_found" in a dialog box.
#
# So the model is a LIST, tried in order. The first one that answers is written
# back into the config, so the fallback costs one wasted request once and
# nothing afterwards. Ordered by capability: routing is the most demanding
# thing Prism asks a model to do, and a weaker one produces worse plans rather
# than visible errors.
# Verified against the live API on 18 Aug 2026 — every entry answered, and
# every entry returned parseable JSON for a routing-shaped prompt. Do not add a
# model to this tuple without checking BOTH: three of the four that used to be
# here were dead, and the survivors are not interchangeable.
#
#   llama-3.3-70b-versatile   404, retired
#   llama-3.1-8b-instant      404, retired
#   gemma2-9b-it              400, decommissioned
#
# So the chain had one working model left and it was third, meaning every plan
# paid for two failed round trips first, and one more retirement would have
# stopped every customer planning anything.
#
# qwen/qwen3.6-27b is deliberately ABSENT although it answers. It is a
# reasoning model that writes a <think> block into `content` — 1531 characters
# of it for a prompt asking only for JSON — so routing would get a plan it
# cannot parse. Answering is not the same as being usable.
#
# Note the reasoning models here put their working-out in a separate
# `reasoning` field and can return EMPTY `content` if max_tokens runs out
# first. Give them room; a short cap reads as "the model returned nothing".

{_stage_lines(agents, premium)}

{notes_block}═══ WHICH STEPS RUN ═══
{premium_rule}- MAKE-STEPS. If the person asks for something to be MADE, the step that
  makes it MUST run — a thinking step only describes it. Map the thing to
  its step:
    image / logo / art / poster ............ VISUAL
    video / reel / animation ............... MEDIA
    voice-over / narration / music ......... AUDIO
    slide deck / presentation .............. PRESENTATION
    web app / website / tool ............... DEVELOPMENT
    document / report / article / script ... CONTENT
  Pair BRAINS with the make-step when the thing needs thinking about first.
- WORDS FIRST. A reel, video or deck needs a script, captions or slide copy,
  and writing those is CONTENT's job, not BRAINS'.
- RESEARCH is for facts from the live web the model would not already know —
  real prices, named companies, recent events, citations. Not for material
  the person has already given you, and not for a simple request.
- ONE STEP IS OFTEN ENOUGH. A question, an analysis or a short piece of
  writing is BRAINS alone. Steps that are not needed make a run slower, not
  better — but never drop a make-step to keep the plan short.
- SUMMARY only when three or more steps ran and their answers need pulling
  together.
- Set "needed": false and "questions": [] for a step that does not apply.
  Never invent a step that is not listed above.

═══ WHAT TO WRITE FOR EACH STEP ═══
- "kind" — what must EXIST when the step ends. Pick exactly one:
    text    an answer written in the chat
    file    a document, deck or spreadsheet the person can download
    image   generated picture(s)
    video   a finished video file
    data    a reply a program will read
    links   companies, contacts or rows
  If the person asked for a .docx, a PDF, a spreadsheet, a deck "as a file"
  or anything to download, that step's kind is "file", never "text".
- "questions" — ONE brief of 40–80 words in plain language: what this step
  is to do, the facts and constraints it needs, and what a good answer
  contains. Write it the way one competent colleague briefs another.
- Do NOT write a role to play ("act as a senior…"), a section list, a word
  count, a quality bar, non-goals, formatting rules, or anything about
  handing over to the next step. Prism adds what it needs itself, and a
  second set of instructions in the same message is what makes a tool answer
  ABOUT the instructions instead of doing the work.
- Never assert something the step will not actually have. Only write a fact
  into a brief if the person gave it or an earlier step will really produce
  it — a brief that says "you have been given the brand colours" when nobody
  found any is worse than one that asks for them.

═══ RULES ═══
- One prompt per step, in the order above. The drafts hold the substance —
  keep every fact, constraint and deliverable in them — but the TOOL and the
  ORDER above are the truth: name the tool the step actually runs on, never
  another one, and hand off to the step that actually follows.
- HAND-OFF: every step except the last says its answer is not for the user —
  it goes to the next step as that step's working brief — and ends with a
  section titled 'HANDOFF FOR <NEXT TOOL IN CAPITALS>' summarising every
  fact, decision and constraint the next step needs.
- FINAL STEP: the last step says the opposite — it is the last step, deliver
  the finished result for the person, no hand-off.
{maker_block}- PROMPT CRAFT: after the opener "Your ONLY task is:", each prompt has
  ROLE (a specific senior expert), CONTEXT (every relevant fact and
  constraint), DELIVERABLE SPEC (the exact output; for a maker, the built
  thing), QUALITY BAR (2–3 concrete criteria) and NON-GOALS. 120–250 words.
- Each prompt is COMPLETE and self-contained.
