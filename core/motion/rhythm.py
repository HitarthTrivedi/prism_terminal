"""
Prism Motion Graphics — the film's rhythm, measured
────────────────────────────────────────────────────
A film that never rests reads as noise and one that never moves reads as a
slide. The polished reference this was compared against (11-12 Nov 2026)
holds still for about a third of its frames, in a few long stretches, and
spends its motion in short bursts; Prism's model-written films moved
continuously (12 % still frames, no hold over 0.7 s) and its Reel never moved.

This renders the resolved spec at low resolution, 10 frames a second,
through the same runtime that will draw it, and measures what a viewer feels:
the share of still frames, the longest holds, how much of the motion falls in
the busiest tenth of the seconds, and the mean brightness. Deterministic, no
model call. `faults()` turns the numbers into sentences a writer can act on.

Method and thresholds are those used on the reference at 10 fps and 192 px
wide: a frame is "still" when it differs from the last by under 0.3 grey
levels on average.
