Prism — email blasts (/email)
─────────────────────────────
Mail-merge through the pipeline: the user attaches a CSV of recipients and a
source document (e.g. a brochure PDF). The pipeline analyses the document,
the drafting agent is locked to output ONLY the email (strict SUBJECT/BODY
format — nothing else survives into the send), and then Prism itself sends
the email to every address in the CSV through the user's own account (SMTP,
stdlib smtplib — no new dependencies).

The CSV is never shown to any AI: recipients are parsed locally, so the
address list never leaves this machine.
