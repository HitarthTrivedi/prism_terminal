Prism Motion Graphics — the authored spine
───────────────────────────────────────────
Authored structure, model-written content.

Two generated Alphakore reels through the story contract (10 Sep 2026)
carried their script in order and passed every gate, and still scored 46
against the reference with a motion correlation near zero: the writer's
scenes entered and sat. Asked for "one continuous transformation", a model
produces a logo and captions. So the transformation is no longer asked
for; it is given. The reference film's grammar is written down here as a
sequence of BEATS, each with the primitives and phases it requires and the
numbers that make them visible, the storyboard turn maps the script's lines
onto those beats, every scene prompt carries its beat's recipe, and a scene
that lacks its beat's transformation is sent back with the recipe.

The recipes' numbers are the authored recreation's (core.motion.fixtures
.inspo_fixture), which scores 84 against the reference — the same
primitives, phases, sizes and counts, with the brand, copy and colours left
to the model. Stdlib only.
