"""
Prism Motion Graphics — per-scene verification
────────────────────────────────────────────────
Checks a SPECIFIC claim a scene's own spec makes against its resolved
geometry — not a generic style rule. This is the MoVer lesson, not the
motion_faults() one: core.reel_web's motion_faults() (reverted — see
motion-plan.md) checked "does one animation dominate" and got gamed by
scattering weak animations to dodge the number. Nothing here checks
whether a scene is *good*; each check answers a factual yes/no that a
model can't cheaply fake — a node is either inside the frame or it isn't,
an entrance either moves the value or it doesn't.

Pure Python, no browser. core.reel_web.inspect() has to launch Chromium
because its ground truth (real HTML/CSS layout) only exists once the page
renders. Motion's ground truth — position, size, animation timing — is
already sitting in the spec before a single frame is drawn, which is
exactly the advantage a from-scratch scene graph has over filming a page.
