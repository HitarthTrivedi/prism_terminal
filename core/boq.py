Prism — Bill of Quantities from a CAD drawing (/boq)
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
No AI ever measures the drawing. A DWG/DXF is real vector geometry — lines,
polylines, arcs, blocks — and an LLM asked to eyeball a rasterized picture of
it can only guess plausible-looking numbers, which is worthless (or worse,
dangerous) for a document a client will price work against. So this module
does the measuring itself, deterministically, with a CAD library that reads
the actual entity coordinates: lengths from LINE/LWPOLYLINE/POLYLINE/ARC,
areas from closed polylines and HATCH boundaries, counts from INSERT (block)
references. The output is a plain quantities CSV — auditable, re-openable in
Excel, and never silently trusted. An AI stage only ever sees THAT structured
data afterward, to write it up as a professionally formatted BOQ document
(item numbers, descriptions, grouping by trade) — formatting is exactly what
it's good at; measuring is exactly what it isn't.

.dwg is a proprietary binary format ezdxf cannot read directly. It must be
converted to .dxf (an open, documented format) FIRST, on the user's own
machine, with one of:

  • GNU LibreDWG (free, scriptable, recommended):
        macOS   →  brew install libredwg          (gives the `dwg2dxf` CLI)
        Linux   →  build LibreDWG from source (many current Debian/Ubuntu
                    repositories do not package the `dwg2dxf` utility)
    Coverage of newer/exotic DWG features is not perfect — good enough for
    ordinary 2D architectural drawings, which is the common case here.

  • ODA File Converter (free, more complete, GUI-first but scriptable):
        https://www.opendesign.com/guestfiles/oda_file_converter
    On Windows it installs under %ProgramFiles%\\ODA\\ODAFileConverter*\\ and
    does NOT add itself to PATH — find_dwg_converter() globs that location, so
    no PATH surgery is needed there. On Linux, put `ODAFileConverter` on PATH.

ensure_dxf() detects whichever is installed; if neither is, it raises a clear
error naming both options rather than failing obscurely.

KNOWN LIMITATIONS (disclosed, not hidden):
  • Curved polyline segments (bulges) are measured exactly for LWPOLYLINE;
    legacy POLYLINE segments are treated as straight (a documented
    approximation — rare in modern exports).
  • HATCH boundaries that are true splines/ellipses are measured via their
    control/fit points, not exact curve integration — fine for the polygonal
    boundaries architectural floor hatches almost always use.
  • Numbers are only as good as the source drawing's layer/block discipline.
    A drawing with everything dumped on layer "0" with no named blocks will
    still parse, but the grouping will be useless — this tool cannot invent
    structure the drawing never had.
