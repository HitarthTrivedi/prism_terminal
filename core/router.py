Prism — the routing brain (Groq)

Takes the user's raw query + their profile + the agents they enabled, and asks
Groq to split the task into a self-contained prompt (or several) for each
pipeline stage — marking stages "needed": false when they don't apply.

Generalised from the original 4-stage version to the full six categories, and
tailored by the user's "what do you do" profile.

# ── surviving Groq ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Hosted open models get retired on a few weeks' notice, and every install
# carries the same default. A single hardcoded model name means the day Groq
# drops it, every customer stops being able to plan anything, at the same hour,
# with "model_not_found" in a dialog box.
#
# So the model is a LIST, tried in order. The first one that answers is written
# back into the config, so the fallback costs one wasted request once and
# nothing afterwards. Ordered by capability: routing is the most demanding
# thing Prism asks a model to do, and a weaker one produces worse plans rather
# than visible errors.
# Verified against the live API on 18 Aug 2026 — every entry answered, and
# every entry returned parseable JSON for a routing-shaped prompt. Do not add a
# model to this tuple without checking BOTH: three of the four that used to be
# here were dead, and the survivors are not interchangeable.
#
#   llama-3.3-70b-versatile   404, retired
#   llama-3.1-8b-instant      404, retired
#   gemma2-9b-it              400, decommissioned
#
# So the chain had one working model left and it was third, meaning every plan
# paid for two failed round trips first, and one more retirement would have
# stopped every customer planning anything.
#
# qwen/qwen3.6-27b is deliberately ABSENT although it answers. It is a
# reasoning model that writes a <think> block into `content` — 1531 characters
# of it for a prompt asking only for JSON — so routing would get a plan it
# cannot parse. Answering is not the same as being usable.
#
# Note the reasoning models here put their working-out in a separate
# `reasoning` field and can return EMPTY `content` if max_tokens runs out
# first. Give them room; a short cap reads as "the model returned nothing".

{profile_line}{attach_line}The user has enabled these pipeline stages (each backed by a specialist AI).
Stages run in this exact order, and each one receives the previous stages'
outputs as context:

{_stage_lines(agents, premium)}

{notes_block}═══ RULES ═══
{premium_rule}- DELIVERABLE RULE (overrides brains-first): if the user asks you to MAKE/BUILD/
  CREATE/DESIGN/GENERATE a concrete artefact, the matching MAKE-STAGE MUST run —
  brains alone only PLANS it, it does not produce it. Map the artefact to its stage:
    • image / logo / art / illustration ............ VISUAL
    • video / animation / voiceover / music ........ MEDIA
    • web app / website / UI / software tool ....... DEVELOPMENT
    • slide deck / PowerPoint / PPT / pitch deck ... PRESENTATION
    • full article / essay / long-form copy / script  CONTENT
  Typically pair BRAINS (plan/outline) → the make-stage (produce it). Never answer a
  "make me an X" request with brains only.
- SCRIPT RULE: a reel, video or deck needs WORDS — script, narration, captions,
  slide copy. Writing those words is CONTENT's job, not BRAINS'. Whenever MEDIA
  or PRESENTATION will produce the deliverable and CONTENT is enabled, add a
  CONTENT stage between the plan and the make-stage to write the exact words.
  BRAINS plans the concept; CONTENT writes the script; the make-stage produces it.
- SCOPE LOCK: every prompt you write MUST begin with the exact words "Your ONLY
  task is:" followed by that stage's job and nothing else. The agent must NEVER
  be asked to produce a deliverable that belongs to another stage. Example: if
  CONTENT is asked for webpage copy and DEVELOPMENT builds the page, the CONTENT
  prompt must end with "Do NOT design or build the webpage itself — output text
  only; the build happens in a later stage." Agents like Claude will build whole
  apps if you leave the door open, so close it explicitly.
- HAND-OFF AWARENESS: for every stage EXCEPT the last one you enable, the prompt
  must state that its output is not for the user — it will be passed verbatim to
  the next enabled stage as that stage's working brief. Instruct the agent to end
  its answer with a concise summary of every fact, decision and constraint the
  next stage needs (names, specs, style choices, wording that must be kept).
- FINAL STAGE: the LAST enabled stage's prompt must say the opposite — "you are
  the final stage; deliver the polished end result for the user, no hand-off."
- BRAINS-FIRST DEFAULT (for non-deliverables): if the task is analysis, a question,
  reasoning, planning, or a short written brief, use BRAINS ONLY.
- Small/simple tasks with no artefact → BRAINS ALONE.
- BRAINS also does the analysis + short brief that would otherwise look like RESEARCH
  or CONTENT. Do NOT add RESEARCH to "analyse this and design a logo" — that is
  BRAINS (analyse + brief) → VISUAL (make the image). Nothing else.
- RESEARCH is reserved for HEAVY tasks needing genuinely new external facts the model
  wouldn't know (complex web builds needing current docs, real market/price data,
  academic citations). Never for analysing given material or simple requests.
- CONTENT is reserved for SUBSTANTIAL writing deliverables. A short brief or plan is
  brains, not content.
- SUMMARY is OFF unless 3+ other stages ran AND need consolidating. With 1–2 stages,
  the final stage's own output IS the answer.
- Prefer ONE stage. Two is common. Three+ should be rare and clearly justified.
- Each stage receives the PREVIOUS stage's output as context (Prism injects it),
  so later prompts should say "using the previous stage's output, do X" rather
  than re-deriving from scratch. Don't ask a later stage to re-analyse raw input
  the earlier stage already handled.
- Set "needed": false (and "questions": []) for stages that don't apply.
- Never invent stages that aren't listed above.
- Each entry in "questions" must be a COMPLETE, self-contained prompt.
- Return an ARRAY of prompts per stage: usually ONE; use multiple only when the
  stage genuinely needs distinct prompts.
- DEVELOPMENT prompts must include full specs so the agent can ship a working
  result. SUMMARY must explicitly reference and combine the earlier outputs.
{self_directing_block}{maker_block}- PROMPT CRAFT (this is why Prism exists — every stage prompt must read like
  professional prompt engineering, never a paraphrase of the user's words).
  After the mandatory "Your ONLY task is:" opener, every prompt MUST contain:
    • ROLE: cast the agent as a specific senior expert matched to the task
      (e.g. "Act as a senior speech-ML researcher who has shipped multilingual
      ASR systems"), not a generic assistant.
    • CONTEXT: the situation plus every relevant fact, constraint and given
      from the task brief — the agent must never have to guess what's known.
    • DELIVERABLE SPEC: the exact output structure — named sections, tables,
      comparisons, word counts, format. Never just "provide a specification";
      list WHICH sections the specification must contain.
    • QUALITY BAR: 2–3 concrete success criteria the output must satisfy
      (e.g. "every model named must include its licence and hardware needs").
    • NON-GOALS: what the agent must NOT do, taken from SCOPE and scope lock.
  A well-crafted stage prompt is typically 120–250 words. A one-line prompt
  that restates the user's request is a routing failure.

═══ RULES ═══
- One prompt per step, in the order above. The drafts hold the substance —
  keep every fact, constraint and deliverable in them — but the TOOL and the
  ORDER above are the truth: name the tool the step actually runs on, never
  another one, and hand off to the step that actually follows.
- HAND-OFF: every step except the last says its answer is not for the user —
  it goes to the next step as that step's working brief — and ends with a
  section titled 'HANDOFF FOR <NEXT TOOL IN CAPITALS>' summarising every
  fact, decision and constraint the next step needs.
- FINAL STEP: the last step says the opposite — it is the last step, deliver
  the finished result for the person, no hand-off.
{maker_block}- PROMPT CRAFT: after the opener "Your ONLY task is:", each prompt has
  ROLE (a specific senior expert), CONTEXT (every relevant fact and
  constraint), DELIVERABLE SPEC (the exact output; for a maker, the built
  thing), QUALITY BAR (2–3 concrete criteria) and NON-GOALS. 120–250 words.
- Each prompt is COMPLETE and self-contained.
