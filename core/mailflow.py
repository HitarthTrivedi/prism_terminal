Prism — the daily loop
──────────────────────
Ties inbox, triage, register, quoting, sop and po together into the one thing
the owner actually does: press *Check my mail*.

One call to check() does everything that cannot cost money if it goes wrong —
fetch, sort, file the attachments, register the inquiries, work out what is due
a follow-up — and hands back a worklist of the things that need a person. It
never sends anything. Sending is the caller's decision, made once per item,
because both remaining human steps are about money leaving the company.

Errors do not raise out of check(). This runs on a ten-minute timer next to
somebody trying to run a factory: a mail server having a bad afternoon belongs
in a status line, not in a dialog box.
