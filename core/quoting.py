Prism — working out the price
─────────────────────────────
Two ways a quotation gets its numbers, because small manufacturers work both
ways and a tool that only understood one of them would not fit anybody:

  **Catalogue.**  The item is on their rate list. Look up the row, apply the
  quantity slab, add tax. Traders, dealers and stockists live here.

  **Cost sheet.**  The item is made to the customer's drawing, so no rate
  exists — nobody has made this exact part before. What the owner does in his
  head is: material weight × rate per kg, plus the process charges, plus
  margin. That is a cost sheet, and it is how every job shop prices.

No AI touches a number in this file
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Every figure here is computed in Python, in Decimal, and a language model is
only ever asked to write the sentences *around* the numbers it is handed. A
model doing arithmetic is approximately right, and approximately right on a
rate that goes to a customer is a loss, an argument, or both.

Decimal rather than float for the same reason. 0.1 + 0.2 is not 0.3 in binary
floating point, GST at 18% of ₹1,42,500 has to come out the same as the
customer's own calculator, and "the software rounds differently from Tally" is
not a conversation worth having.
