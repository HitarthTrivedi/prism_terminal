Prism — skills: the doctrine layer
──────────────────────────────────
A skill is one folder that says what a good result looks like for one job,
and — where a program can tell — checks the result against that.

    skills/<key>/
        SKILL.md      frontmatter (what it is for) + the doctrine itself
        checks.py     optional: faults(text, context) -> list[str]
        examples/     optional: golden outputs the doctrine points at
        references/   optional: long material for people; never typed

Why this exists
───────────────
Prism already knew a great deal about what a good BOQ, a good cold email
or a good reel looks like. That knowledge was spread over eighteen modules
as f-strings, so changing a rule of thumb meant a release, a customer
could not add their own, and the router was asked to *improvise* a role,
a deliverable spec and a quality bar from scratch on every run. A skill
is the same knowledge as a file: shipped with the app, overridable by the
customer, listed to the router so it can pick rather than invent, and —
the half that makes it more than a prompt — paired with a check the run
can act on.

Two ways in
───────────
  · ROUTED. The router sees every skill's `description` under the stages
    it applies to (`stages:` in the frontmatter) and puts the fitting keys
    in that stage's "skills" list. `assign()` validates what it chose and
    falls back to `triggers:` matched against the person's own words, the
    same way the make-stage guardrail backs up the router. automation.run
    then types `block()` into the stage prompt after the person's words.
  · FEATURE. An add-on that builds its own prompt (BOQ, drafting, Reel …)
    appends `addendum("<feature>")` — the skills whose `features:` list
    names that job. Nothing is injected when no skill claims the job, so
    every existing prompt is byte-identical until a skill folder says
    otherwise.

Overrides, and what may not be overridden
─────────────────────────────────────────
  ~/.prism/skills/<key>/SKILL.md   replaces the shipped doctrine
  ~/.prism/skills/<key>/notes.md   is appended to it ("field notes")
  ~/.prism/skills/<new-key>/...    adds a skill of the customer's own
checks.py is loaded ONLY from the shipped folder. A skill served from the
licence server or written by hand may change what a tool is told; it may
not run code on the customer's machine.

Budgets
───────
The browser tools take one blob of text and a long prompt slows typing and
crowds out the person's own request, so over "browser" transport a body is
cut at `budget:` characters, at a paragraph boundary. Direct API calls
("api") get the whole body. Authors put the important rules first.

# because automation._capture takes Selenium's element text. That is not
# markdown. Measured over the owner's 93 saved replies on 2026-09-11: no table
# pipes, no bold markers, list bullets and numbers gone, a heading as a bare
# short line, a table row as its cells joined by single spaces, and a
# Perplexity citation as a bare site name on its own line under the claim.
# The first checkers were written for markdown and misfired on nearly every
# real answer. These read the captured shape, and markdown as well, because a
# model sometimes types markdown where the chat does not render it.
