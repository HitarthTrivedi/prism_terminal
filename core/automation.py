Prism — browser automation
───────────────────────────
Drives the user's logged-in Chrome (via undetected-chromedriver) through each
needed pipeline stage: opens the tool, types the prompt(s), waits, scrapes the
response, and passes it forward as context to the next stage.

Ported from the original prism_new.py, generalised to N categories and decoupled
from Google Drive. Selenium/uc are imported lazily so the REPL and dry-runs work
even on machines where they aren't installed yet.

    case in an office — and that lands in %LOCALAPPDATA%\\Google\\Chrome\\

    check LOCALAPPDATA, while LOGIN TABS said "Chrome not found — opening in
    your default browser instead. Logins there will NOT carry into Prism's

    A response_selector is a selector LIST: ChatGPT's is three alternatives,
    Claude's four, because those sites serve different markup to different
    accounts on the same day. `f"{sel} img"` reads as "everything in the list
    EXCEPT the last one, plus images inside the last one" — the descendant
    combinator binds tighter than the comma. Written out, ChatGPT's came to:

        [data-message-author-role='assistant'],      ← the message DIV itself
        [data-message-role='assistant'],             ← ditto
        .markdown.prose img                          ← only this branch scoped

    So the harvesters got message CONTAINERS back, not images or links. Both
    then treated a <div> as the thing they were looking for: `get_attribute
    ("src")` and `get_attribute("href")` are None on a div, so every one was
    skipped — and because the list HAD matched something, neither fell back
    to searching the whole page. The net effect was that a generated image
    and a generated .docx were invisible to Prism on the two most-used tools
    in the registry, every single time.

    Splitting is comma-aware of brackets, parens and quotes: `[data-x='a,b']`
    and `:is(.a, .b)` are both legal in a selector and both contain a comma
    that does not end an alternative.

    anchor ever written, attribute or no attribute. So the obvious
    `download_attr is not None` test below was true for every <a href> on the
    page, and _harvest_files stopped being a filter at all: it fetched the
    first four links in DOM order — sidebar entries, "Help", the tool's own

    a nav link), and hit its cap of 4 long before reaching the .docx the
    stage had actually produced. That is the "documents and images aren't
    coming back from the agents" report, and both halves of it: the real file
    was never fetched, and what did get saved had no usable extension.

    get_dom_attribute() is the one that reads the attribute itself, and it
    keeps the distinction the caller needs: None when there is no attribute,
    "" for a bare `<a href="/api/file/9" download>` — which IS a deliverable,
    it just carries no filename to take an extension from. Guarded with

    itself can, and it joins the same pipeline_files list _harvest_images
    already feeds so a later producer stage receives it the same way.

    _harvest_images finds its candidates by shape — an <img> sized like a
    real picture rather than an icon or avatar. There is no equivalent
    universal signal for a document, so the candidate test is different (a
    link whose href plainly points at a file: a real extension, an explicit
    `download` attribute, or a `blob:` URL — how Code-Interpreter-style
    "Download" buttons usually work), but everything around that test is the
    SAME mechanism reused rather than reinvented: search the response area
    first, fall back to the whole page (a tool's download UI can sit outside
    the message bubble the same way ChatGPT's image canvas does), fetch the
    bytes through the page's OWN session so an auth-gated link still
    resolves, and hand back an attachment record built the normal way
    (core.files.attach, the same function a user's own upload goes through).

    Unlike an image, there is no "screenshot the element" fallback when the
    fetch fails — a rendered pixel grid can stand in for a picture; nothing
    can stand in for a PDF. A candidate that can't be fetched is skipped.

    For the "audio" stage specifically, an <a href> download link is often
    not how the result appears at all — ElevenLabs/Suno-style players
    typically hand back an <audio> element instead, with no anchor anywhere.
    Unverified against either tool's real DOM (no live account to test
    against), but harmless to try: `currentSrc` is read via JS because that
    reflects what the player actually loaded, not just a static `src`

# Two halves to the fix. agents._APOLLO_HANDOFF makes the previous stage write
# a fixed block of filter lines instead of prose; everything below parses that
# block and puts the values into Apollo's own search URL.
#
# Why the URL and not the filter widgets: Apollo mirrors its entire search
# state into the address bar, so navigating to a built URL sets the same
# filters as clicking through the left rail — without touching a single one
# of the class names that rail is built from. The results grid is the only
# part of the DOM this still depends on.
#
# The parameter names are Apollo's own, read off the address bar of a search
# built by hand in the UI. If Apollo renames one, that filter silently stops
# applying (the search still runs, just wider) — so a run that comes back
# with obviously unfiltered results means it is time to build the search in
# Apollo once and compare its URL against _APOLLO_PARAMS.

         it is what builds the deck; the reply then carries a preview card
         and "Your N-slide presentation ... has been created".

    The thread URL is the link Prism keeps: the deck opens from its card
    there, and the design also lands in the customer's Canva Projects.
    Best-effort throughout, like the NotebookLM runner: every step fails
    soft with a message rather than hanging the run, and stop/skip/
    fallback are polled between the long waits.

    Canva COMPOSE the image — a stock template where DALL-E would have

    — by core.motion.generate.build_spec() inside the storyboard stage's
    own handling (see the motion_feeder block further down this file).
    This just finds that JSON among the completed stages and renders it.
    Unlike _run_studio()'s web.parse_spec(), a plain json.loads() is
    correct here rather than a corner-cutting shortcut: build_spec()
    already did the messy-LLM-reply repair work upstream and its own
    output (json.dumps() of a validated spec) is clean by construction.

    """Execute the pipeline. Returns (responses, links).

    fallback_signal: a threading.Event the screen sets for "Use fallback" —
                 stop waiting for the tool on the stage that is running and
                 hand that stage to the next tool in its category NOW, the
                 way the failover pass would after the cap ran out. For the
                 person who can see the tool has errored and does not want
                 to sit out a 600-second wait for Prism to notice. Cleared by
                 the engine per press, like skip_signal.

    image_stages: stage keys the caller PROMISES will produce a picture —
                 /step-auto's "visual" stage, the STEP dialog's Draft. Such a
                 stage gets the full image budget (minutes, like Reel's
                 artwork) instead of the short look a generic visual turn
                 gets, because on those a picture is possible, not certain.

    attachments: list of records from core.files.attach() — uploaded to each
                 tool and their extracted text prepended to the first prompt.
    query: the user's original task — gives the file-analysis stage its focus.
    chatgpt_analysis: when attachments exist, prepend a ChatGPT stage that
                 analyses the files first (skipped if the pipeline already
                 starts with ChatGPT, or when the caller routes its own
                 analysis, e.g. /email).
    custom_stages: an explicit, pre-built (stage_label, agent_name, questions)
                 list, used instead of deriving stages from `routing`. Unlike
                 `routing` — one agent per fixed PIPELINE_ORDER category — this
                 can name any agent any number of times in any order (e.g. a
                 research pass, a structuring pass, back to the same agent
                 again). Stage labels only need to be unique WITHIN this list
                 (they key the responses/links dicts and drive the next-stage
                 handoff); they don't need to match a real category name.
    reel_design_stage: the label of a stage that art-directs a reel, when the
                 caller built the stages itself. That stage's reply is turn one
                 of a conversation — the look and the storyboard — and the
                 scenes are then asked for one at a time in the same tab. A
                 routed run finds this stage on its own; only a caller passing
                 `custom_stages` has to name it.
    motion_design_stage: the same idea as reel_design_stage, for core.motion
                 instead of core.reel_web — that stage's reply is turn one
                 (project, camera, storyboard rows), and core.motion.generate
                 asks for each scene's nodes one at a time in the same tab.
                 Motion has no routed-run auto-detection (it isn't in
                 core.agents' catalogue), so every caller names this stage
                 itself — there is no "a routed run finds this on its own"
                 case the way there is for reel_design_stage.
    motion_skeleton: optional core.motion prompt profile. ``cinematic_glass``
                 keeps one visual subject moving through the film and adds
                 continuity metadata; ``brand_launch`` retains the legacy
                 four-role treatment. If omitted, Motion uses cinematic_glass.
    on_event(kind, payload) is an optional callback for live UI updates.
    should_stop() is an optional predicate polled between and during stages.

    skip_signal is an optional threading.Event the GUI sets when the user
    presses "Skip this step": the CURRENT stage stops waiting, whatever the
    tool had produced is kept, and the run moves on to the next stage. The
    engine clears the event when it acts on it, so one press skips one step
    — a leftover press can never eat the stage after it. This is the way
    out of a tool stuck generating (an image that never finishes, a site
    whose selectors have moved) without throwing away the whole run.
                 A routed run drives a browser for minutes at a time, so a
                 caller with a Stop button needs a way to be let go of that
                 isn't killing the process. When it returns True the run
                 finishes the current poll, emits "cancelled", and RETURNS what
                 has already landed rather than raising — a cancelled run still
                 has real output in it, and throwing that away punishes the
                 user for stopping. The browser is deliberately left open, same
                 as every other exit from here.
    failover: after the pipeline, hand any stage that produced NOTHING to a
                 different tool from the same category and try once more. On by
                 default, because the failure it covers — a free tier running
                 out at the last stage of a forty-minute run — otherwise costs
                 the whole run. Set False for the retry itself, so a category
                 where every tool is having a bad afternoon cannot recurse.
    pipeline_files_out: a caller-owned list that images/files generated during
                 this run are appended into, on top of being used internally.
                 Exists so a failover retry — which runs this whole function
                 again from scratch for one stage via `custom_stages` — can get
                 the images that ONE stage generated back out, when otherwise
                 they would be harvested into this function's own local
                 `pipeline_files` and vanish with it when the call returns.

    """Give each empty stage to a different tool.

    The failure this exists for: forty minutes into a run, the free tier on
    whichever tool drew the heaviest stage runs out, and the customer is handed
    a pipeline that did nine tenths of the work and produced nothing usable.
    Another tool in the same category can almost always finish it.

    **It runs after the pipeline, not inside it, and that is a real
    limitation.** A stage that failed in the MIDDLE has already handed nothing
    to the stages after it, so those ran on thinner context and are not re-run
    here. The last stage — which is where a quota runs out, because that is
    where the most has been asked — is fully recovered. Doing better means
    retrying inline, which means restructuring a 500-line loop whose index-keyed
    maps (machine_stages, spec_feeder, design_feeder) all shift if the stage
    list changes underneath it.

    One case of that limitation IS fixed here, though, because it doesn't need
    the restructuring: a LOCAL renderer (Prism Reel, Prism Studio) runs as one
    self-contained function call, not a browser tab holding its place in the
    stage list — so if `visual` failed and only came back through this retry,
    the renderer already ran without the images it was waiting on, and calling
    that same function again is safe. See `_rerender_local_after_recovery()`,
    called at the end of this function once every stage here has been tried.

    Never raises: this is a rescue attempt, and a rescue that takes down the
    results it was rescuing would be worse than not trying.

    "Skip this step" works in here too. It did not: the nested run() below
    was started without the skip flag, so a press during a retry — the one
    place a customer is most likely to press it, watching a second tool
    grind on the same stuck stage — did nothing at all. Now the flag is what
    the nested run's waits poll (as a stop, so it winds up quietly and keeps
    what landed), and a press abandons the remaining alternatives for that
    stage rather than trying the next tool anyway.
